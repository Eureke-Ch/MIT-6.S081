1. a0-a7 registers contain arguments. a2 holds 123.
2. at address 0x26, we can see the complier directly loads 12 into a1 register, which is just the return value of f(8) + 1.
3. printf lies at address 0x630.
4. ra saves the return address 0x38.
5. the output is "He110 world". If the RISC-V were instead big-endian, we need to set i to 0x726c6400 in order to yield the same output. We don't need to change 57616 to a different value.
6. the value in register a2 will be printed after 'y=', which is quite random.
